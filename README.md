<b>Operating System:</b> macOS

<b>CMake version:</b> 3.30.3

<b>Note:</b> I wrote my original code using VScode on my mac laptop. However, I have edited it using the computers in the lab room, therefore it runs perfectly on the computers' <b>VScode</b>, not the regular Visual Studio (not tested so not confirmed).

<u>Instructions to compile the program:</u>
1. Open the folder (cpsc-453-raytracing) using VScode.
2. Select the 'Unspecified' kit (if needed).
3. Build the program using CMake (exit code should be 0).
4. Open a new terminal.
5. Enter the following: 
```bash
cd build
./453-skeleton
```

<b>Note:</b> The window takes a minute to open after running ./453-skeleton. Please be patient!

If you are having troubles with building (running cmake with the output dropdown / build button at the bottom toolbar), enter the following into the terminal:
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
./453-skeleton
```
